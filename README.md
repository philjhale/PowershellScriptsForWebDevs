PowershellScriptsForWebDevs
===========================

Many people have told me PowerShell is a very powerful tool but for a long time I failed to see how it was useful to me as a web developer. So, I made an effort find out what it can do and use it where possible. This repository is a collection of scripts that I have found useful. 

I'm not a PowerShell expert, I'm not even a novice so the scripts are very basic.
